# Tic Tac-Toe 2 players
This is a Tic Tac Toe game made as a practicing project with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Player 1 will always have X's, and player 2 will have O's.

# How it works
I know that 99% of the world population know the rules, but just in case. Rules are simple : There is a grid. 9 cells. 2 players. These players have to fill the cells with either 'O' or 'X' symbols. The first one to align the same symbol 3 times horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins the game.
