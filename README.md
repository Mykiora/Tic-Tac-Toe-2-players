# How it works
I know that 99% of the world population know the rules, but just in case. Rules are simple : There is a grid. 9 cells. 2 players. These players have to fill the cells with either 'O' or 'X' symbols. The first one to align the same symbol 3 times horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins the game.
